# OSS intial tests.
## This is just a test to prepare and experiment for something greater visions.     <br/>

> For the starters, I would like people to add few lines of public codes to the code.py file.

> Any line would suffice like print(OSS) or print('Your name here')

> Then add your name in the contributors.md list.

> This is something for me and you to experiment with.

> A cool project Idea is about to come from my account so I needed a hands on experience on how to handle this OSS repositories online.

> Maybe you guys can help me in regards to it.

> Thanks, much appreciate it.

> Do wait for something unique OSS coming from my repo.

> Those who are intrested to be in that future projects do input their name in the future.md.

> I need someone who has a little experiences with open source licenses and how they work and some experinces on how to manage repositories and things about it.

> Thanks you all for your help and support and guidance and mentorship, we will be creating something unique.
